wip fps/tps

platformer is at index.html and host:port/platformer.html
ocean demo is at host:port/ocean.html

note: in order for servor to live reload,
the app your working on has to be the index.html (thats why there's 2 copies of the platformer html)
i wanted to use servor's directory index as a kind of launch screen for dev, but it broke hmr. sadface
i'll probabyl use something else to make this happen
